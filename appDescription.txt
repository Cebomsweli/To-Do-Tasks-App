1. Priority Levels for Tasks
Add a feature to allow users to set priorities for each task (e.g., Low, Medium, High). This will help users focus on the most important tasks first.
You could display tasks with the highest priority at the top of the list or color-code tasks based on their priority.
2. Search Functionality
Allow users to search for tasks by name, due date, or priority. This can help users quickly find a specific task, especially when there are many tasks in their list.
Implement a search bar to filter tasks dynamically.
3. Task Categories (Tags)
Let users categorize their tasks by tags (e.g., "Work," "Personal," "Shopping," etc.). This can help users organize their tasks into different categories and quickly filter by tag.
You could display these tags as small labels next to the task name or as a filter option in the sidebar.
4. Due Date Reminders/Notifications
Add email or push notifications to remind users about tasks that are approaching their due date.
You could integrate this with external services like Twilio or email APIs to send reminders.
5. Recurring Tasks
Allow users to create tasks that repeat at regular intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
This can be useful for regular activities such as paying bills, exercise routines, etc.
6. Task Sorting and Filtering
Allow users to sort tasks based on different criteria, such as due date, priority, or task status (Pending, Done).
You could also allow filtering tasks to show only "high-priority" tasks, tasks due today, or overdue tasks.
7. Task Completion Time
Add an option for users to track the time taken to complete a task.
Users can log the time spent on each task when they mark it as done, which is useful for time management.
8. Task Description/Notes
Allow users to add additional notes or descriptions for each task. This could be useful for users who need more detail on a task before completing it.
You could make the task description visible on the task list or as a tooltip when hovering over a task.
9. Task Sub-Tasks (Nested Tasks)
Enable users to break down large tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks.
Sub-tasks can be nested within a main task and marked as completed separately from the main task.
10. Data Backup/Export
Allow users to download their tasks, history, or archived tasks as a CSV or JSON file for backup purposes.
You could also add the ability to import tasks from a CSV/JSON file.
11. Dark Mode
Implement a dark mode theme for users who prefer a darker interface.
This could be toggled in the settings or the sidebar for better accessibility and user experience.
12. User Authentication
Add authentication (sign-in/sign-up) to store users' tasks securely.
You can use Firebase Authentication, Auth0, or simple session management with a username and password.
13. Task History Statistics
Display statistics about tasks, such as how many tasks were completed last week, the percentage of tasks done on time, or average time spent on tasks.
Create simple charts or graphs using libraries like matplotlib or plotly to visualize these statistics.
14. Task Sharing
Allow users to share their tasks or task lists with others. For example, a user could share a list with a friend or a team member for collaborative task management.
You could add a simple sharing feature by generating a link to share the list.
15. Task Comments/Collaborative Notes
Allow users to add comments to tasks, making it easier to collaborate with others on shared tasks.
This could be especially useful for teams or users working together on shared projects.
16. Task Prioritization (Drag-and-Drop):
Implement a drag-and-drop feature where users can easily rearrange the order of tasks based on their priority or urgency.
17. Mobile Responsiveness
Make the app responsive so it works well on mobile devices. Streamlit is already mobile-friendly to some extent, but you can optimize the UI further for small screens.
18. Task Analytics (Completion Rate)
Track and display analytics such as the percentage of tasks completed, overdue tasks, and trends over time. You can display this information in a graph.
19. Pomodoro Timer for Focused Work
Integrate a Pomodoro timer to help users focus on tasks by working in intervals (e.g., 25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break).
This could be useful for productivity and time management.
